				<h3>Knight's tour</h3>

				<p>
					A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard
					such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight
					ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square
					(so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same
					path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open. The
					knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a
					knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common
					problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight's
					tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 ×
					8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

				<h3>Theory</h3>
				<p>
					The knight's tour problem is an instance of the more general
					Hamiltonian path problem in graph theory. The problem of finding a
					closed knight's tour is similarly an instance of the Hamiltonian cycle
					problem. Unlike the general Hamiltonian path problem, the knight's
					tour problem can be solved in linear time.

				<h3>Existence</h3>
				<p>
					Schwenk proved that for any m × n board with m ≤ n, a closed knight's
					tour is always possible unless one or more of these three conditions
					are met:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>m and n are both odd</li>
					<li>m = 1, 2, or 4</li>
					<li>m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Cull et al. and Conrad et al. proved that on any rectangular board
					whose smaller dimension is at least 5, there is a (possibly open)
					knight's tour.
				</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h3>Number of tours</h3>
				<p>
					On an 8 × 8 board, there are exactly 26,534,728,821,064 directed
					closed tours (i.e. two tours along the same path that travel in
					opposite directions are counted separately, as are rotations and
					reflections). The number of undirected closed tours is half this
					number, since every tour can be traced in reverse. There are 9,862
					undirected closed tours on a 6 × 6 board.

				<h3>Finding tours with computers</h3>
				<p>
					There are several ways to find a knight's tour on a given board with a
					computer. Some of these methods are algorithms while others are
					heuristics.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Brute-force algorithms</b><br />
					A brute-force search for a knight's tour is impractical on all but the
					smallest boards. For example, there are approximately 4×1051 possible
					move sequences on an 8 × 8 board, and it is well beyond the capacity
					of modern computers (or networks of computers) to perform operations
					on such a large set. However, the size of this number is not
					indicative of the difficulty of the problem, which can be solved "by
					using human insight and ingenuity ... without much difficulty."

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Warnsdorff's rule</b><br />
					Warnsdorff's rule is a heuristic for finding a single knight's tour.
					The knight is moved so that it always proceeds to the square from
					which the knight will have the fewest onward moves. When calculating
					the number of onward moves for each candidate square, we do not count
					moves that revisit any square already visited. It is possible to have
					two or more choices for which the number of onward moves is equal;
					there are various methods for breaking such ties, including one
					devised by Pohl and another by Squirrel and Cull. This rule may also
					more generally be applied to any graph. In graph-theoretic terms, each
					move is made to the adjacent vertex with the least degree. Although
					the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-hard in general, on many graphs
					that occur in practice this heuristic is able to successfully locate a
					solution in linear time. The knight's tour is such a special case. The
					heuristic was first described in "Des Rösselsprungs einfachste und
					allgemeinste Lösung" by H. C. von Warnsdorff in 1823. A computer
					program that finds a knight's tour for any starting position using
					Warnsdorff's rule was written by Gordon Horsington and published in
					1984 in the book Century/Acorn User Book of Computer Puzzles.

					<b>Neural network solutions</b><br />
					The knight's tour problem also lends itself to being solved by a
					neural network implementation. The network is set up such that every
					legal knight's move is represented by a neuron, and each neuron is
					initialized randomly to be either "active" or "inactive" (output of 1
					or 0), with 1 implying that the neuron is part of the solution. Each
					neuron also has a state function (described below) which is
					initialized to 0. When the network is allowed to run, each neuron can
					change its state and output based on the states and outputs of its
					neighbors (those exactly one knight's move away) according to the
					following transition rules:
					<span
						><img
							width="250"
							height="125"
							alt="neural network rules"
							src="public/images/neural.png"
					/></span>
					where <i>t</i> represents discrete intervals of time,
					<i>U(N<sub>i,j</sub>)</i> is the state of the neuron connecting square
					<i>i</i> to square <i>j</i>, <i>V(N<sub>i,j</sub>)</i> is the output
					of the neuron from <i>i</i> to <i>j</i>, and
					<i>G(N<sub>i,j</sub>)</i> is the set of neighbors of the neuron.
					Although divergent cases are possible, the network should eventually
					converge, which occurs when no neuron changes its state from time
					<i>t</i> to <i>t + 1</i>. When the network converges, either the
					network encodes a knight's tour or a series of two or more independent
					circuits within the same board.
